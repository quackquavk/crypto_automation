He googled it and ended up at a scam site and it asked for his phantom wallet password (not his seed) he entered the pw (NOT THE SEED) what will happen, what should he do. I understand this is just pw for his device/ phone so unless the scammers have his phone he should be ok. If you google Solayer, u can see see the scam site ",

This is in part because of the rise of memecoins during the same period cos users need $SOL to operate on the chain.  \n  \nThe price action has been good since then and project like Solayer are leveraging this opportunity to offer $SOL stakers new yield opportunities.  \n  \nThe protocol has managed to attract over $180M in TVL and close a private funding round with Binance Labs.  \n  \nCurrently, Solayer has over 301k users with $359.14M in Sol deposit with a yield of 8.9% and with the listing on Bitget around the corner, Solayer is one project to keep an eye on.  \n  \nWhat are your thoughts Solayer?",

                "description": "Alright, if you‚Äôre into staking on Solana but still want to keep things liquid, you‚Äôve probably come across BGSOL, BNSOL, and bbSOL. These tokens basically let you earn staking rewards while staying flexible with your assets. I did a little digging, so here‚Äôs a quick comparison to help you figure out which one might suit you best.\n\n# Estimated APR &amp; Earnings\n\n* **BGSOL**: This one‚Äôs got a solid base APR of¬†**8.15%**, but with extra incentives from Bitget, it can hit¬†**30.15%**. Plus, if you stake the first¬†**$1,000**¬†via Bitget Wallet on the Solayer Restaking Network, you can earn¬†**up to 25% APY**. Not too shabby, right?\n* **BNSOL**: The APR here is¬†**dynamic**, but Binance hasn‚Äôt shared exact numbers (thanks, Binance üôÑ).\n* **bbSOL**: No fees at all ‚Äì¬†**0% management fee, 0% validator commission,**¬†and¬†**0% withdrawal fees**. The only cost is a¬†**0.1% SOL deposit fee**. So if you're allergic to fees, bbSOL might be the move.\n\n# Redemption &amp; Liquidity\n\n* **BGSOL**: No lock-in period ‚Äì you can¬†**redeem whenever**¬†you feel like it.\n* **BNSOL**: There‚Äôs a¬†**4-day wait**¬†if you want to convert BNSOL back to SOL.\n* **bbSOL**: It‚Äôs¬†**tradeable**¬†on Bybit and other exchanges. The info I found didn‚Äôt say if there‚Äôs a waiting period, so it seems pretty chill on that front.\n\n# Where You Can Use These Tokens\n\n* **BGSOL**: Works across a bunch of DeFi platforms like¬†**Orca Dex, Solayer, Kamino**, and¬†**Save Lending**. Also gets you access to Bitget‚Äôs¬†**LaunchPool and PoolX**, plus potential¬†**airdrops**.\n* **BNSOL**: Mostly useful on¬†**Binance**¬†for¬†**trading, lending**, or adding to¬†**liquidity pools**.\n* **bbSOL**: You can use it with¬†**Orca, Kamino**, and¬†**Solayer**¬†‚Äì nice little DeFi ecosystem going on here.\n\n# What Makes Each One Special\n\n* **BGSOL**: Comes with¬†**Active Validator Set (AVS) delegation**, making it faster and more secure.\n* **BNSOL**: Super simple with a¬†**one-click staking process**¬†and the usual Binance-level security and support.\n* **bbSOL**: It‚Äôs the¬†**first exchange-backed LST**¬†and runs on the¬†**SPL stake pool program**, which has gone through a bunch of audits.\n\n# So, Which One‚Äôs Right for You?\n\nHonestly, it all comes down to what you‚Äôre after:\n\n* If you want¬†**higher APR**¬†and more¬†**DeFi options**, go with¬†**BGSOL**.\n* If you‚Äôre already using¬†**Binance**¬†a lot,¬†**BNSOL**¬†makes sense.\n* If you hate fees and like¬†**trading your tokens freely**,¬†**bbSOL**¬†is the way to go.\n\nSo yeah, for me BGSOL really seems to steal the spotlight, especially if you‚Äôre looking for high rewards, flexibility, and utility. What do you guys think? Let me know would love to hear your thoughts!\n\nSource:  \n[https://blockchain.news/flashnews/whale-converts-sol-to-bgsol-for-enhanced-staking-benefits](https://blockchain.news/flashnews/whale-converts-sol-to-bgsol-for-enhanced-staking-benefits)  \n[https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitget-first-liquid-restaking-token-bgsol-with-solayer-labs/](https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitget-first-liquid-restaking-token-bgsol-with-solayer-labs/)  \n[https://www.forbes.com/digital-assets/assets/bybit-staked-sol-bbsol/https://dune.com/wuyihuigpt/bbsol-overview-dashboard](https://www.forbes.com/digital-assets/assets/bybit-staked-sol-bbsol/https://dune.com/wuyihuigpt/bbsol-overview-dashboard)\n\n[https://learn.sanctum.so/blog/introducing-bbsol](https://learn.sanctum.so/blog/introducing-bbsol)\n\n[https://www.cryptotimes.io/2024/09/10/binance-launches-sol-staking-with-bnsol-token-in-rewards/](https://www.cryptotimes.io/2024/09/10/binance-launches-sol-staking-with-bnsol-token-in-rewards/)\n\n[https://www.altcoinbuzz.io/bitcoin-and-crypto-guide/guide-to-binance-sol-staking-earn-rewards-with-bnsol/](https://www.altcoinbuzz.io/bitcoin-and-crypto-guide/guide-to-binance-sol-staking-earn-rewards-with-bnsol/)",

It is rumoured that its TGE is coming in Q4 this year, so it's not long now!\n\nA few weeks ago I made a Berachain guide here: \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1frwy14/sharing\\_the\\_steps\\_to\\_farm\\_berachain\\_testnet\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1frwy14/sharing_the_steps_to_farm_berachain_testnet_the/) \n\nThink of this earlier guide as a \"**Part 1**\" farming guide, and if you have not seen it please read the post.\n\nSince then I have found even more steps. In this guide, I will share with you **everything** you need to do to farm **Berachain** fully for maximum points when it finally drops. This is completely free to farm by the way since its in testnet.\n\n**\"Part 1\" Guide above: Summarising all the important steps you must do (full steps in guide above):**\n\n**Step 1: Faucet at** [https://bartio.faucet.berachain.com/](https://bartio.faucet.berachain.com/)¬†. You can get 1 Bera every 8 hours. I recommend visiting this faucet daily to get as many Bera as possible.\n\n**Step 2:** **Add LP to farm BGT (see guide), stake LP**\n\n**Step 3: Claim free BGT from the LP, delegate (see guide).**\n\n**Step 4: Complete all the quests at** ¬†[https://www.cubquests.com/](https://www.cubquests.com/)¬†**. Claim NFTs after completing.**\n\n**Step 5: Use all the features under the \"explore\" tab** (see screenshot below), there are a bunch of things you can do - make transactions on each of \"**BGT station\" , \"Honey\", \"BEND\" and \"BERPS\"** (see below)\n\n[Link: https:\\/\\/bartio.bex.berachain.com\\/](https://preview.redd.it/kmnyab4c3jvd1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=862f228808a7eb537faa9c3a144e2c7ebef6b032)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g3j7yrcf4jvd1.png?width=579&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16421cf63d5f465afd7f52eae4df793a068d01a2\n\n**All done?

Deposit your LP tokens. (Note: Leave some iBGT leftover for Dapp 2)** (Note: you can put gas to aggressive mode to speed up Berachain transactions)\n\nStep 3b: On the same page, **Stake** your LP tokens after you deposit.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ja7ugolt5jvd1.png?width=616&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69763efcc33354a18ca36bc458399065fba93bd3\n\nStep 4: Go back to swap, to swap Bera to some **KDK tokens**\n\nStep 5: Go to the \"Staking\" tab (beside liquidity, see first pic). **Convert your KDK to xKDK, then allocate and stake your xKDK**.\n\n**Dapp 2: InfraRed**\n\n**Step 1:** Go to [https://infrared.finance/](https://infrared.finance/)\n\n**Step 2:** Go to vaults: [https://infrared.finance/vaults](https://infrared.finance/vaults) : With the iBGT you swapped from KodiakFi earlier, **deposit into the iBGT vault**\n\n**Dapp 3: Beranames:**\n\n**Step 1: Go to** [https://www.beranames.com/](https://www.beranames.com/), and mint a Bera username (similar to ENS). 1 year is sufficient imo for the lowest price, you can mint more names if you get more Beras from the faucet daily.\n\n**Dapp 4: OogaBooga**\n\nStep 1: Go to [https://www.oogabooga.io/](https://www.oogabooga.io/), launch app\n\nStep 2: Swap Bera to Ooga token\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3gxb1jzr7jvd1.png?width=736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92bcd299e1661b4cdcdfc88c8d9373a7047993fb\n\n Step 3: Go to staking tab, [https://app.oogabooga.io/stake](https://app.oogabooga.io/stake) and stake your OOGA token\n\n**Dapp 5: Beradrome**\n\nStep 0: Get some Honey from bera on [https://bartio.bex.berachain.com/swap](https://bartio.bex.berachain.com/swap)\n\nStep 1: Go to [https://beradrome-frontend-v1.vercel.app/swap](https://beradrome-frontend-v1.vercel.app/swap) and swap Honey to Bero\n\nStep 2: Go to farms, and explore to deposit on a LPs of your choice\n\n**Dapp 6: Goldilocks**\n\n**Step 1: Go to** [https://www.goldilocksdao.io/goldiswap/swap](https://www.goldilocksdao.io/goldiswap/swap) and buy LOCKS\n\nStep 2: Stake Locks\n\nStep 3: Go to the GoldiLend tab. Mint free NFT, and \"Create Loan\" using the free NFT minted.\n\n**And there you have it: The FULL and COMPLETE GUIDE to farm Berachain!**\n\n**Pro Tip 1: Don't feel pressured to farm everything all at once - I did all the steps across a number of weeks. You can explore 1 Dapp a day when you get your free Bera from visiting Faucet**\n\n**Pro Tip 2: Visit faucet as often as possible, I recommend daily**\n\n**Pro Tip 3: Stay updated with the quests on** [**https://www.cubquests.com/quests**](https://www.cubquests.com/quests) **, maybe on a weekly basis**\n\nBerachain could come in the coming month and will probably drop soon, Q4 this year.

                "description": "üö®Just IN: Berachain Attracts $1.7 Billion in Pre-Launch Liquidity\n\nIn a staggering display of investor enthusiasm, Berachain, the highly anticipated layer-1 blockchain, has managed to amass an impressive $1.7 billion in pre-launch liquidity deposits. Despite not having launched its mainnet yet, Berachain's pre-launch deposit vaults have become a magnet for crypto investors eager to secure early rewards.\n\nThe pre-launch program, which includes collaboration with various protocols such as StakeStone, Lombard Finance, and ether.fi, allows users to deposit assets like Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and Ethereum (ETH) to gain early access to the Berachain ecosystem. This initiative has attracted over 130,000 active wallets, with deposits split across 12 different protocols.\n\nThe strategy behind this pre-launch frenzy is to solve the notorious \"cold start problem\" that many new blockchains face. By bootstrapping liquidity early, Berachain aims to ensure that its decentralized applications (dApps) have the necessary depth and functionality from day one, preventing users from losing interest due to lack of liquidity.\n\nBerachain's Boyco platform, described as a pre-launch liquidity hub, is set to play a crucial role in this process. Boyco will seamlessly integrate the liquidity aggregated from the pre-launch vaults, creating a robust ecosystem where dApps and users can negotiate directly with liquidity providers for incentives.\n\nThe rewards for participating in these pre-launch vaults are substantial, with users receiving stacked rewards from multiple projects within the Berachain ecosystem, such as Lombard, Babylon, Concrete, Kodiak, and Dolomite. For instance, StakeStone vaults hold over $450 million, while ether.fi has attracted nearly $480 million.\n\nThis early liquidity surge has propelled Berachain to the 10th largest blockchain by Total Value Locked (TVL), surpassing notable blockchains like Avalanche and Aptos. With its innovative proof-of-liquidity consensus mechanism and recent $100 million funding, Berachain is positioning itself for a significant impact in the crypto space.\n\nAs the mainnet launch approaches, just weeks after the Boyco launch, the excitement and anticipation around Berachain continue to grow. It's clear that this blockchain is not just another player in the crypto world but a potential game-changer.\n\n#crypto #blockchain #Berachain #liquidity #DeFi #cryptocurrency #investing\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer: This analysis is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.",
